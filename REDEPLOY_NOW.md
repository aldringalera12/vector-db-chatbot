# 🚀 Redeploy Now - App Crash Fixed

## ✅ What Was Fixed

I've improved the app to handle missing database gracefully:

1. **Better error logging** - Shows exactly what's happening
2. **Auto-creates database directory** - If it doesn't exist
3. **Better error messages** - Easier to debug
4. **More resilient startup** - Won't crash on missing files

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" button
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 2: Check Logs
1. Go to "Logs" tab
2. Look for success messages:
   ```
   ✅ Chatbot initialized successfully
   📊 Database contains 1234 definitions
   ```

### Step 3: Test
```powershell
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

---

## ✨ Expected Success

After redeploy, you should see:
```
📁 Using database path: ./vector_db
📚 Using collection: definitions
✅ Using existing collection: definitions
✅ Chatbot initialized successfully
📊 Database contains 1234 definitions
🚀 Server running on 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## 🔍 If Still Crashing

Check the logs for the specific error. Common issues:

### Issue 1: "COHERE_API_KEY not set"
**Solution:** Add to Railway Variables
- Name: `COHERE_API_KEY`
- Value: `m7uIZhmn9itLRlZmEvHVwIJ6nvJ0FU2zZ5vd40e9`

### Issue 2: "Database error"
**Solution:** App will auto-create it now

### Issue 3: "Collection error"
**Solution:** App will auto-create collection now
