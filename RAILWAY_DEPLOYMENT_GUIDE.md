# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to deploy your FastAPI Vector Database Chatbot to Railway.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free)
- Railway account (free)
- Your Cohere API key
- Git installed on your computer

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Local Repository

### 1.1 Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
cd c:\Users\aldri\OneDrive\Desktop\chunk
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: FastAPI chatbot with vector database"
```

### 1.2 Create `.env` file locally (for testing)
```bash
# Copy the example file
copy .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Cohere API key
# COHERE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 1.3 Test locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fastapi_chatbot.py
```
Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs

---

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

### 2.1 Create a new GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `vector-db-chatbot`
3. Choose "Private" (to keep your API key safe)
4. Click "Create repository"

### 2.2 Push your code
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vector-db-chatbot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Set Up Railway Account

### 3.1 Create Railway Account
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start Free"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

### 3.2 Create New Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `vector-db-chatbot` repository
4. Click "Deploy"

---

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

### 4.1 Add Environment Variables in Railway
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on the "fastapi_chatbot" service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the following variables:

```
COHERE_API_KEY=your_actual_cohere_api_key_here
DB_PATH=./vector_db
COLLECTION_NAME=definitions
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

**Important:** 
- Replace `your_actual_cohere_api_key_here` with your real Cohere API key
- Keep `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` for now (update later for production)

### 4.2 Verify Variables
- Click "Save"
- Railway will automatically redeploy with new variables

---

## Step 5: Monitor Deployment

### 5.1 Check Deployment Status
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Watch the build progress
3. Look for green checkmark when complete

### 5.2 View Logs
1. Click "Logs" tab
2. You should see:
   ```
   âœ… Chatbot initialized successfully
   ðŸ“Š Database contains XXX definitions
   ```

### 5.3 Get Your Public URL
1. Go to "Settings" tab
2. Look for "Public URL" or "Domain"
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://vector-db-chatbot-production.up.railway.app`)

---

## Step 6: Test Your Deployed API

### 6.1 Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database_count": 1234,
  "api_connected": true
}
```

### 6.2 Test Chat Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is PRMSU?"}'
```

### 6.3 Test in Android Studio
Update your Android app to use:
```
BASE_URL = "https://your-railway-url"
```

---

## Step 7: Update CORS for Production

### 7.1 Get Your Android App Domain
- If using localhost: `http://localhost:8080`
- If deployed: `https://yourandroidapp.com`

### 7.2 Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Variables"
3. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,https://yourandroidapp.com
   ```
4. Save (Railway will redeploy)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Chatbot not initialized"
**Solution:** Check that `COHERE_API_KEY` is set in Variables

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution:** Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are listed

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Railway automatically assigns PORT via environment variable (already handled)

### Issue: Vector DB not persisting
**Solution:** Railway volumes persist by default. Check "Volumes" tab in settings.

### Issue: Slow first request
**Solution:** Normal for Railway free tier. First request takes 5-10 seconds.

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Real-time Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, click "Logs" tab
# Logs update in real-time
```

### Check Resource Usage
1. Go to "Metrics" tab
2. Monitor CPU, Memory, Network

### Redeploy After Code Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main
# Railway automatically redeploys
```

---

## Free Tier Limits

- **500 hours/month** = ~16 hours/day continuous
- **5 GB storage** (your vector_db is 35 MB âœ…)
- **Unlimited requests** (within fair use)
- **Auto-scaling** included

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Deploy to Railway
2. âœ… Test all endpoints
3. âœ… Update Android app with Railway URL
4. âœ… Monitor logs for errors
5. Consider upgrading to paid tier if you need 24/7 uptime
