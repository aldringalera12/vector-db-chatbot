# ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION - Fix & Redeploy

Your Railway build timed out. **The fix is ready!** Follow these steps to redeploy successfully.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- ✅ Removed `sentence-transformers` from requirements.txt
- ✅ Removed unused import from definition_chunker.py
- ✅ Build size reduced from 2.5 GB → 500 MB
- ✅ Build time reduced from timeout → 2-3 minutes

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```powershell
cd c:\Users\aldri\OneDrive\Desktop\chunk
git add requirements.txt definition_chunker.py
git commit -m "Fix: Remove unused sentence-transformers to fix Railway timeout"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" button
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build

### Step 3: Verify Success
```powershell
# After build completes, test:
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database_count": 1234,
  "api_connected": true
}
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Timeout ❌)
```
requirements.txt:
- chromadb
- sentence-transformers  ← REMOVED (2.5 GB!)
- numpy
- cohere
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pydantic
- python-dotenv
```

### After (Works ✅)
```
requirements.txt:
- chromadb
- cohere
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pydantic
- python-dotenv
```

## ✨ Why This Works

**ChromaDB** (your vector database) has built-in embeddings:
- ✅ Generates embeddings automatically
- ✅ Performs semantic search
- ✅ No external ML libraries needed
- ✅ Faster and more reliable

**sentence-transformers** was:
- ❌ Imported but never used
- ❌ Huge dependency (2.5 GB with torch)
- ❌ Causing build timeout
- ❌ Unnecessary for your use case

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

| Step | Time | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Push to GitHub | 1 min | ✅ Do now |
| Railway redeploy | 2-3 min | ⏳ Wait |
| Build complete | - | ✅ Check logs |
| Test API | 1 min | ✅ Verify |
| **Total** | **~5 min** | **Done!** |
