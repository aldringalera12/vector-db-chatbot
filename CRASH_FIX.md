# 🔧 App Crashed - Quick Fix

## Problem
Your app crashed on startup. The error was likely related to the vector database not being found or initialized properly.

## What I Fixed
I've made the app more resilient:

1. **Updated `fastapi_chatbot.py`**
   - Added better error logging
   - Creates database directory if it doesn't exist
   - Better error messages with traceback

2. **Updated `definition_chunker.py`**
   - Ensures database path exists before initializing
   - Better error handling
   - More informative logging

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```powershell
cd c:\Users\aldri\OneDrive\Desktop\chunk
git add fastapi_chatbot.py definition_chunker.py
git commit -m "Fix: Make app more resilient to missing database"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Check Logs
1. Go to "Logs" tab
2. Look for these messages:
   ```
   ✅ Chatbot initialized successfully
   📊 Database contains 1234 definitions
   ```

### Step 4: Test
```powershell
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

## ✅ Expected Output

After successful deployment:
```
📁 Using database path: ./vector_db
📚 Using collection: definitions
✅ Using existing collection: definitions
✅ Chatbot initialized successfully
📊 Database contains 1234 definitions
```

## 🎯 If Still Crashing

Check the logs for specific error. Common issues:

1. **"COHERE_API_KEY not set"**
   - Add COHERE_API_KEY to Railway Variables

2. **"Database not found"**
   - App will create it automatically now

3. **"Collection error"**
   - App will create new collection if needed
